# Code Refactor (test)

## Description
This Code Refactor project was a test of my debugging skills. I performed a review of the HTML and CSS code and performed the following updates:
- Replaced numerous <$div$> elements with easier to read semantic elements.
- Added *alt* text to images for improved accessibility. 
- Consolidated CSS code to remove redundancies and patch the updated element changes in the HTML.
- Added comments to the HTML and CSS code to improve code clarity.

Additionally, there was a navigation bug that was discovered during the course of the project - this was also addressed.
